Objective : this is the code to publish data(eg. sensor readings ) from nodes (devices like arduino ) and subscribe them on a central system (jetson nano in our case) , so in our code what we are doing is , we have conneced the 2 arduino unos to 2 potentiiometers and they are connected to one jetson nano ,as shown in demo video.
