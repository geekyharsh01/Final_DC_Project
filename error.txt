To run single arduino:
rosrun rosserial_arduino serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0 


To solve library related issues 
rm -rf ros_lib
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .



If you are using arduino micro and getting : Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino
add the following line to the begining of your ino file
#define USE_USBCON

 

To print rosenv like rosip 
printenv | grep ROS



if roscore doesn't work or establish connection to some other ip address where we are not able to ping
nano ~/.bashrc

ROS_IP=localhost
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
and then save the file 
Save the file and then reload your .bashrc file to apply the changes:




for cstring.h error-  remove std infront of memcpy
also remove cstring.h to string.h
in the library - rosserial arduino library ->src->ros->msg.h
